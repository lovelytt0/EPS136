    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this lab are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Make corrections to the gravity data collected on the San Andreas Fault. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Make a __semi-infinite sheet__ model of a density contrast in order to infer the basin structure of the San Andreas Fault using a reasonable guess for starting model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Invert for the parameters of the perturbation to fit to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our gravity data was collected over a strike-slip fault, so for your solution you will need to model the anomaly with a __negative or positive__ gravity contrast for a semi-infinite sheet. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For each counter reading, we should have a location, and elevation at which we made the reading. We will correct the data for latitude, Bouguer, and Free Air correction, which means that we need vectors corresponding to the location and elevation, and gravity (mGal) for each point. Please fill '???' in the following cell to extract these information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please do not forget to average the data collected at the same location before fitting the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1\n",
    "Please convert instrument readings to uncorrected milligal values (g0) using the following table. If you don't remember how to do this, please review Lab3. The following is the part of table you need.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2\n",
    "Find the base station (Westernmost point) in all reading sites. Tell me which point is the base station? Please write down the index number in the cell. For example, if you think it's 5th point, you can fill the first and second \"???\" with \"lon[4]\" and \"lat[4]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After filling \"???\", you will plot the lat and lon to see the locations of the base (blue square) and reading sites (red triangles) automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Our readings consisted of latitude and longitude in degrees. Once you have vectors of latitude and longitude in degrees, you may need to convert these points to distances in km along your profile. We will make the simplifying assumption that our gravity survey is simply a cross section of the sedimentary basin, that way we only need to find the distance from the base (Westernmost point) to each reading site along it. Do this by setting our Westernmost survey point as our origin, and using the gps2dist_azimuth function in obspy. You can use help function to know the usage of gps2dist_azimuth function.\n",
